This old code will not be built, and is left for reference

There is some sort of PDF caching and some fortran interfaces
As of xfitter version 2.2.0, they no longer work
Some functions have been reimplemented for 2.2.0, see src/fortran_interface.cc

I leave the files here for now, but remove this directory from Makefiles.
