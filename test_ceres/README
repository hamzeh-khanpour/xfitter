1) Install CERES following
   http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html

   but altering cmake command
     -- to change install directory
     -- to build ceres as a shared library
  to
    DIR_NAME=where_you_want_to_place_ceres
    cmake  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${DIR_NAME}ceres ../ceres-solver-1.14.0

  For me, the sequence was

     cmake  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/glazov/fitdir/ceres ../ceres-solver-1.14.0
     make install



3) Modify COMPILE_ME, to point to QCDNUM and CERES libraries

4) Compile the code as

  ./COMPILE_ME

This should produce "hello_xfitter"  executable

5) Make sure that CERES and XFITTER libraries are in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, i.e. export something like

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/glazov/fitdir/ceres/lib/:/home/glazov/fitdir/mini/xfitter/lib

6) Go to the default directory, which contains steering.txt and parameters.yaml files (one directory up), run

test_ceres/hello_xfitter

You should get convergence after 243 iterations.
